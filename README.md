This Work is a simple web page of a fictional Architecture company, written basically in HTML, CSS and a bit of plain JS.
The CSS code was generated through the SASS Preprocessor, The page is decently responsive except for large screens. This work was meant to be an experimentation of what I learnt about web technologies.
